This [article](https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-automation-affects-high-skill-workers-more-often-but-low-skill-workers-more-deeply) talks about the effects of automation on high-skilled workers vs low-skilled workers. 

I find this article interesting given that automation is generally thought to disproportionately affect low-skilled workers. However, the research presented in this article shows that even though low-skilled workers have a harder time recovering from automation based layoffs, high-skilled workers are more widely affected.

According to the authors:

>"...highly-paid workers are more commonly affected, but the effects are more severe for less well-paid workers"

It'll be interesting to see if this trend still holds going into the future.
